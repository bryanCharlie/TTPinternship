            <p>Simon, a 1-year-old Border collie mix who was also an abuse survivor, had been at the same vet for several weeks recovering from a bad case of mange, a skin disease. When the two first met, it was an unforgettable moment. Hero dog takes 3 rattlesnake bites, saving girl and grandma from potential attack Sammie was lying on the X-ray table when Simon was let out of his kennel. He went straight to Sammie and put his paw on the table. The two touched noses. The dogs seemed to form an instant connection, according to Stacey Silverstein, the cofounder of Rescue Dogs Rock NYC.</p>
            <p>“The picture really speaks for itself,” Silverstein told TODAY. “You can see Simon comforting Sammie. It shows that animals have compassion and they feel. Simon would go to Sammie’s kennel to comfort him and play with him and sit with him often.” This brawny ‘Game of Thrones’ actor has the cutest, tiniest workout partner Silverstein says the two formed a strong bond while they were at the vet together, with Simon acting as Sammie’s caretaker. After the rescue posted the photo of Simon and Sammie to their Facebook page, it wasn’t long before their story went viral. It has since been shared over 4,000 times.</p>
