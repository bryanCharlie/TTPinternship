It’s not unusual these days for family pets to attain Internet fame — but this week, Tara the “hero cat” is reigning as queen over them all.

<p>
A one-minute surveillance video captured the normally mellow family cat saving her human family member, a 4-year-old California boy named Jeremy Triantafilo, from a harrowing and unprovoked dog attack. After the video went viral on Wednesday—(it has been seen more than 17 million times on YouTube alone)—the Triantafilo family appeared on TODAY on Thursday to talk about how Jeremy is recovering from his injuries.

“For the cat-loving world, this was our Lassie moment,” cat behaviorist and host of Animal Planet’s “My Cat from Hell” Jackson Galaxy told TODAY.com. “It gives an opportunity to reexamine what cats are.”

Tara’s daring rescue was remarkable, but she isn’t the only feline to save a human from danger or death. Here are five more outstanding examples of kitties coming to the rescue:
